3. Install the package - try out some of itâ€™s functionality as it is outlined in the documentation
4. Prepare brief report to report about tomorrow
5. Paste parts of functioning code which you tried on your own.
6. Write a short report which you will submit
    a. what the package is about?
    b. What is the typical usecase fo the package.
    c. Did you understand the documentation? If not, why was it difficult to understand? What was easy to understand?
    
### Asking for help
Imagine the imagionary function `calculate_correlation(series_a, series_b)` is 
a. returning zero for a two series for which function `cor()` returns 0.75. 
b. sometimes returns NA (Missing value)
c. It is erroring out, returns values above 1. 

Formulate proper questions with minimal working example, which you would post on stack overflow forums. Include all necessary information. If unsure about something, make it up :)
